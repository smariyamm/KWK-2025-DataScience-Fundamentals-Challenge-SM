# KWK-2025-DataScience-Fundamentals-Challenge-SM

### ***This repository is dedicated to keeping track of my progress as I find my way through this challenge


## Picking my Topic:
- While studying Computer Science as my major, I have chosen Intelligence & Cybersecurity and Privacy as my threads (concentrations).
- I took my very first Cybersecurity class Spring of 2025, and I've learned quite alot regarding cyber activity including cyber criminal activity -- how cyber criminals act, and even the psychology behind it all as well as how victims behave and why. I was assigned many readings reagrding recent cyber attacks on major companies and the technical aspects of why they occured to begin with. The class was extremely interesting, and I want to use what I learned in this class to figure out how I can analyze cyber activity for this challenge.

## Problem Statement

Over the years cyberattacks have continued to grow, they have become more frequent and extremly sophisticated costing businesses and organizations billions of dollars while affected millions of victims who have theirsensitive data exposed. Beacuse of the nature of cyber attacks, thousands of causes are documented every year but its not always clear which vulnerabilites are most commonly exploited and which attack methods adversaries favor.

Finding my way through this challenge I plan to seek answers to two key questions:

1. What are the most common system vulnerabilities that are targeted by cybercriminals?
2. What attack methods are most favored by adversaries to exploit these vulnerabilities?

By analyzing cybersecurity incident and vunerability datasets, the goal of this project is to find trends in how attackers operate. By understanding these patterns, we can be proactive about future cyber attacks by prioritizing defense strategies, improve detection of anomalies, and allocate our resources effectively to prevent million to billion dollar losses. This is especially important considering the risk of cyberattacks is only projected to over the upcoming years


## Possible APIs
- https://www.kaggle.com/

According to my short research, both of these sites have the type of datasets I am looking for and I am allowed to use their data. And a perk each dataset has a 'usability' score that determines variables like Completeness, Credibility, and Compatibilty so I can have insights on my datasets.


# Module 2
- learned how to clean datasets (very basic cleaning, specifying what headers I need, dropping rows with missing values etc.)
- Cleaned my 4 datasets

# Module 3
